# SmartLCD Minimotors
Warning : this is work in progress. I decline all responsability about using informations from this project.

## What is SmartLCD ?
It's a combo of electronic and smartphone application. It extend all features from original Minimorots EYE LCD and controller.
The electronic board will interract with most of the e-scooter electronic when you plug it.
You simply place the little box inside the deck and connect it to the controller (and other electric parts if you want more features)

### What can be done ?
I suggest you to have a look at all planed features in the image below.
There is almost no limit in custom features.
The controller power cannot exceed the nominal power, but with a shunt, you can go upper and still have a current control loop to limit the current by software (and avoid burning the controller).

Most settings will be configurable by the smartphone, and additionnal hardware buttons will allow you to control specific features.

Some examples : 
- it can lock the escooter with bluetooth proximity (with a beacon, the smartphone or any bluetooth device). When locked, the power is so reduced that nobody can ride it is you aren't close enouth.
- you find the acceleration trigger to agressive at low speed ? you can change the acceleration curve for smooth trigger at low speed, and still have the beast once you push the trigger harder.
- you want a mode for some weather conditions like 'rainy' with less torque ? no problem. Use the customized "mode Z" in addition to mode 1/2/3 with special P7/P8/P9/PA.
- you feel the electric brake too strong at full power ? the progressive electric braking adjust the brake power in real time.

## Case and size
Current size : 6cm x 3cm x 2cm (will shrink a little at final stage)
